        A.J. Towns, an acclaimed self-published author, commissioned me to create book cover art for her works. 
        This collaboration involved multiple meetings to discuss the narratives and ensure the visuals captured 
        the essence of her stories. For the artwork, I utilized Procreate, starting from initial sketches to the 
        final polished designs. Once completed, I also used Procreate to present the book cover mockups in a 
        professional format.

                This story follows a medieval baker, a single father of two young children, who falls in love with a 
                high noble. Towns envisioned the cover illustrating the protagonist's family life with a rustic, 
                warm tone. I designed a dynamic scene where the baker is at the forefront, busy baking, while his 
                children are playfully causing chaos in the background—a cohesive and engaging visual narrative.

            For Towns' debut novel, *Thane’s Promise*, I created two distinct covers. The softcover features detailed 
            character art, highlighting my illustration of the protagonist, Thane. For the hardcover, I crafted a 
            design resembling an elegant party invitation envelope, aligning with the novel's themes of intrigue 
            and grandeur.
