        As the Animation Lead and Costume Designer for my Vertically Integrated Project, CineInnovate Studios, 
        I was responsible for managing a team of designers and creating the costumes for our characters. For 
        this process, I began by using Procreate to sketch the initial designs, then modeled the costumes in 
        Marvelous Designer. Afterward, I refined the models in Blender, adding final touch-ups and texturing. 
        The shoes and clothing were sourced from free assets on Sketchfab.

                    Moto, the main character, required a vibrant outfit that matched his eccentric personality. 
                    After deciding on the pattern for his sweatshirt, I created the design and textures on the UV 
                    unwrap in Procreate. Once the outfit was modeled in Marvelous Designer, I moved to Blender to 
                    apply the UV wrap and fine-tune the details.

                For David, I modeled the beanie in Blender, while the rest of his outfit was pieced together in 
                Marvelous Designer. Similar to Moto, I created the patterns on a UV unwrap in Procreate and applied 
                the texture in Blender.
